# PrintBoard-AI-Virtual-Keyboard

A real-time virtual keyboard that allows users to **type using hand gestures** — no physical keyboard required! Built with **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **Python**, this project uses a **webcam** to detect hand landmarks and type letters based on finger positioning and long-press gestures.
